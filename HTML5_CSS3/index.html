                    Real electrical distribution networks are subject to uncertainties due to market prices, demand variation, and increasing of
                    distributed energy resources. The advent of low carbon technologies brings unfold benefits to the electrical grid; however, 
                    tradicional distribution networks we were not designer to hold a high penetration of this techonology.
                    Theferore, a transition in electrical distribution networks towards an active distribution network would enable a real time operation
                    and managment of the system. Thus, prosumers and utilities would play an active role for energy market in the near future.
                    Having said that, probabilistic market tools are essential to cater an ever increasing stochasctic behaviour of the grid 
                    due to widely adoption of low carbon technoligies.
